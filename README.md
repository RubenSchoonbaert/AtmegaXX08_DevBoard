Overview

This repository contains the design files for the ATmegaxx08 Development Board V1.2, a compact and versatile development board centered around the ATmegaxx08 family type MCU's (This was tested with 1608 and 3208) microcontroller. The schematic includes all necessary components for powering, programming, and extending the functionality of the microcontroller. This board is ideal for prototyping and embedded system development.
Key Features

    Microcontroller:
        ATmega1608 (U1) microcontroller serves as the core of the development board.
        Supports UPDI programming.

    Power Supply:
        Powered via a micro-USB port (U13).
        Integrated 3.3V voltage regulator (AMS1117-3.3) to provide stable power for the system.
        Optional power fuse (F1, 500 mA) for overcurrent protection.

    Programming and Debugging:
        UPDI programming header for uploading firmware.
        Serial-to-USB converter CH340C (U2) for UART communication and debugging.
        NOTE some PCS might need to install a driver to use the CH340C

    Integrated Peripherals:
        Real-Time Clock (RTC): Includes a DS3231 RTC module for timekeeping applications, with a 32.768kHz crystal.
        Accelerometer: MPU6050 sensor (U4) for motion and orientation detection, interfaced via I2C.

    Indicator LEDs:
        Power and activity LEDs for visual feedback.
        RX and TX LEDs for UART communication.

    Logic Level Conversion:
        Logic converter for interfacing between 3.3V and 5V peripherals.

    Breakout Headers:
        Exposes all microcontroller pins for easy prototyping and integration with external modules.

    Optional Components:
        Mounting holes (MH1-MH4) for mechanical stability.
        Optional connectors (X1) for additional customization.

Block Diagram

The schematic is divided into functional blocks:

    ATmega1608 Core: Central microcontroller circuitry.
    Power Supply: USB input, voltage regulator, and fuse for stable operation.
    Peripherals: RTC, accelerometer, and breakout headers for system expansion.
    Programming and Communication: UPDI header and USB-to-serial converter.
    Logic Conversion: Ensures compatibility between 3.3V and 5V peripherals.
    Indicators: LED indicators for debugging and status monitoring.

Notes

    The board includes clear labeling for all components and connections.
    Optional Components:
        X1 is an optional connector.
        F1 provides additional power protection but can be bypassed if not needed.
    Breaking S1 will disable the power LED to reduce power consumption.

Applications

This development board is well-suited for:

    Embedded system prototyping.
    Sensor integration (e.g., accelerometer applications).
    Time-sensitive applications with the onboard RTC.
    Low-power and IoT projects.

Getting Started

    Powering the Board:
        Connect via the micro-USB port for power and programming.
    Programming:
        Use the UPDI header to upload firmware.
        Debug via the UART interface.
    Extending Functionality:
        Use breakout headers to integrate external sensors, actuators, or modules.
        Leverage the onboard peripherals for advanced applications.
